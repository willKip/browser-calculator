# Online Calculator

(This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum), an open-source self-directed web development course.)

Simple in-browser calculator built on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Mouse input works as well as keyboard input. Escape resets the calculator,
Backspace deletes a digit. Sign change has no corresponding key.

Keyboard input will highlight the corresponding button that was pressed in the UI.

Division by zero will display an error and reset calculator values.
